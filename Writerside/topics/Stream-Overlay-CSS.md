# Stream Overlay CSS

## Structure

The Overlays generated by this module have specific CSS classes and IDs attached to them.

They are structured and nested and can be overridden using OBS's CSS Feature.

The topmost element also has the class "obs-utils" in case multiple overlay plugins are rendering something on /stream.

* .overlay 
* * .actor #actor[actor id]
    > Actor ID is the Foundry Actor ID (i.e. "abcde231231cas")
* * * .[overlay-type] #overlay[overlay id]
      > Overlay ID is the Array Index
      >
      > Available overlay types are:
      > * single-line-overlay
* * * * .component .[component-type] #component[component id]
        > Component ID is the Array Index
        >
        > Available component types are:
        > * actor-val-component
        > * fa-icon-component
        > * plain-text-component

## Overriding in the Editor

There also is the option to edit the styles directly within the editor

These will create inline style data on the HTML tags for either the overlay or the component.
