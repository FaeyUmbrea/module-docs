# Getting Started

Hello and welcome to Ethereal Plane!

This module aims to bring deep integration with streaming services to FoundryVTT.

## Key Features

Ethereal Plane offers several powerful features to enhance your streaming experience:

- **Polls**: Create interactive polls for your viewers to vote on
- **Triggers**: Set up interactive elements that can execute macros in response to stream events
- **Roll Broadcasting**: Share your dice rolls with your stream chat

## Getting Started

The Wiki will serve as user documentation and hopefully provide you with all the information you need.
Just checkout the sidebar and click on the topic of your choosing.

We recommend starting with the [Quick Start](quick-start) guide and then exploring the [Triggers](triggers) feature to create interactive elements for your stream.
